###Project: Rossman Kaggle Challenge Solution

Rossman's Store Sales challenge, hosted by Kaggle, asks volunteers to forecast sales for one of their supermarkets using
features of the store itself and of its nearby competitors.

The challenge can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales

The features by which a forecast can be made include sales for a given day, whether it was a holiday, if and what type
of promotion was going on, the number of customers served, and the distance to the nearest competitor store.

The competition provides one dataset of these features and the corresponding sales response, contained in `train.csv`.
The `test.csv` file is used to forecast sales for a given set of features, and is the method by which the submission
receives its submission score from Rossman.

Our approach to forecasting sales will involve [how we plan to move from concept to 'validated approach'].

Our approach is informed by previous research in this area, including: [research papers]
