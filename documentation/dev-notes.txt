Machine Learning TODO:

- Expand feature set: DONE-ISH
- Run regressions with expanded feature set
- Analyze findings of regression
- Neural network with the expanded feature set
- Analyze findings of neural network
- Summarize the research papers
- Clean-up / Write-up
- PPoint for presentation?

Expanded Feature Set:

- plan for blank values: add zeros to Competition and promo2 stuff

- Competition Open Since (in 3 columns, month column, day column, year column):
	- Turn this into a single value, Unix time, relative to the record's date.
		- Ex. Competition has been open for 12 months

- Promo2 stuff:
	- Is promo2 running?
	- If so, how long has it been running in the interval? (The day of month effectively)
	- How long has the store had promo2s?

CUSTOMERS:::
- Average number of customers for this store for this week

- Average number of customers on a school holiday for that store

- Average number of customers on a state holiday for that store

- Highest and lowest customers for this store ever

- Standard deviation of customers for this store ever

SALES:::
- Average number of sales for this store ever

- Average sales when its a school holiday

- Average sales when its a state holiday

- Average sales for this week over all stores

- Average sales for this week for this store

- ****Log of the sales value:
	- According to Kaggle forum, helps scale large variations in the sales data
